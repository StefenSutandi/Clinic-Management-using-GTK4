# Clinic Management Project using GTK4

A clinic in city X is implementing a patient record system for patients who come for medical examinations and/or treatment. Until now, clinic X has been manually recording patient visits in a book (see the attachment from the file DataPMC20232024.xls as the record from clinic X). As a developer, you are tasked with creating a patient record application for clinic X with the following features:

## Features

- **Patient Data Management**: 
  - Add, modify, delete, and search for patient data for those who visit clinic X.
  
- **Visit History Management**: 
  - Add, modify, delete, and search for the history of visits, diagnoses, and treatments for patients who come to clinic X.
  
- **Patient Information Access**: 
  - Provide patient information and their medical history at clinic X to medical staff.
  
- **Revenue Reporting**: 
  - Generate reports on monthly and annual revenue, as well as the average annual revenue obtained by clinic X.
  
- **Patient Statistics**: 
  - Provide information on the number of patients and the diseases suffered by patients (sorted from highest to lowest) per month and per year.
  
- **Follow-Up Notifications**: 
  - Inform medical staff about patients who need to return for follow-up visits.

## Technologies Used

- **GTK4**: For building the graphical user interface.
- **Programming Language**: C for build the backend system.
  
## Goals

The goal of this project is to streamline the patient record management process at clinic X, improving efficiency and accuracy in handling patient data and medical history.

## Skills Developed

- Application development using GTK4
- Database management and integration
- User interface design
- Software testing and debugging

This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for managing patient records and enhancing the overall efficiency of clinic operations.
