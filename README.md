# Clinic Management Project using GTK4

A clinic in city X is implementing a patient record system for patients who come for medical examinations and/or treatment. Until now, clinic X has been manually recording patient visits in a book (see the attachment from the file DataPMC20232024.xls as the record from clinic X). Based on this, you (as a developer) are requested to help create a patient record application for clinic X with the following features:

1. Add, modify, delete, and search for patient data for those who visit clinic X.
2. Add, modify, delete, and search for the history of visits, diagnoses, and treatments for patients who come to clinic X.
3. Provide patient information and their medical history at clinic X to medical staff.
4. Generate reports on monthly and annual revenue, as well as the average annual revenue obtained by clinic X.
5. Provide information on the number of patients and the diseases suffered by patients (sorted from highest to lowest) per month and per year.
6. Inform medical staff about patients who need to return for follow-up visits.
